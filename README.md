# Tutorial

To set this self-bot up, you will need to download python, and allow the 'pip' module to be installed, and I would also recommend for you guys to check the *'Add Python to enviroment variables' option.*

Once you have done this, you can check if you have installed python successfully by writing pip3 into your command prompt which you open by pressing your windows key and writing cmd.exe. 

**If everything is fine, it will show you a lot of commands you can do with pip, but we will only have to use pip3 install.**

Once you have done this, make sure you have cmd open and write in these commands seperately, one by one:
* pip3 install discord
* pip3 install colorama
* pip3 install requests

Once you have done this, open your config.json file from the folder you have extracted the self-bot into, and make sure to paste your token into the area where it says 'INSERT TOKEN', if you do not know how to get your token, I suggest you go watch a video about it, or else you're just weird and shouldn't really be using a self-bot.

If everything goes fine, you should be able to run the element.py file in the folder, and it should work. 

*If you are having problems, contact night#0403 on discord and he will help you sort out the problems.*

**I will not take any credits for creating this self bot, as Yanny#1970 and burden/abby's acc#0223 made it.**

**I will also recommend you to not use the commands that embed your messages a lot as this can get your account terminated on discord, PLEASE USE WITH CAUTION, I HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY WITH YOUR ACTIONS**



Happy skidding!

> Will update if anything new appears from the creators.
 
> You can delete the readme and license file after you have done everything.
 
>I also suggest not using the fdmall command unless you know how to change it through the code, I cannot be bothered making it say a custom message.
